# Summary of the research project
This research project aims to design and develop a functional demonstrator of a portable device for long-term Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements. The proposed device intends to address the need for continuous and non-invasive monitoring of cardiac activity over extended periods, providing valuable insights into the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular conditions.
In addition to enabling long-term Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, the developed wearable device will also incorporate advanced sensors to monitor body position, physical activity, and body temperature continuously. This comprehensive approach aims to provide a holistic assessment of the user's physiological status, allowing for a more thorough evaluation of their overall health. 
The primary objective of this project is to create a working prototype that can serve as a foundation for future advancements in the field. The successful development of this device will facilitate subsequent research projects, fostering innovation and further exploration of long-term ECG monitoring technologies at our institution.
Throughout the research process, various aspects, such as hardware design, signal processing algorithms, power efficiency, and user-friendliness, will be carefully considered and optimized to ensure the device's reliability and practicality. Additionally, emphasis will be placed on achieving a cost-effective solution without compromising the quality of data collected.
Ultimately, the successful completion of this project will lay the groundwork for subsequent investigations, encouraging a continuous cycle of research and development in the domain of portable long-term ECG monitoring. The findings and insights gained from this study will contribute significantly to the improvement of cardiac healthcare and enhance the quality of life for individuals with cardiovascular conditions.
